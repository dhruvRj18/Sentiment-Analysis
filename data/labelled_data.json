Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.\n\nShapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.\n\nThe Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.\n\n----\n\nWe are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.\n\nI think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come.

There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.\n\nBackground: \n\nOwen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.\n\nShapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.\n\nThe Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.\n\n----\n\nWe are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.\n\nI think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come.

COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020.

And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.\n\nThis election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. \n\nI just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).\n\nSo, what is the plan for 2024 ?\n\n&#x200B;",

Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.\n\nThis election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. \n\nI just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).\n\nSo, what is the plan for 2024 ?\n\n&#x200B;",

Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.\n\nShapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.\n\nThe Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.\n\n----\n\nWe are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.\n\nI think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come.

Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. \n\nI just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).\n\nSo, what is the plan for 2024 ?\n\n&#x200B;",

There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.\n\nBackground: \n\nOwen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.\n\nShapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.\n\nThe Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.\n\n----\n\nWe are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.\n\nI think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come.

And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.\n\nThis election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. \n\nI just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).\n\nSo, what is the plan for 2024 ?\n\n&#x200B;",

And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.\n\nThis election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. \n\nI just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).\n\nSo, what is the plan for 2024 ?\n\n&#x200B;",

Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.\n\nShapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.\n\nThe Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.\n\n----\n\nWe are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.\n\nI think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come.

And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.\n\nThis election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in \"Zuck bucks\" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who \"voted\" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.\n\nBut forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. \n\nI just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).\n\nSo, what is the plan for 2024 ?\n\n&#x200B;",

So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.\n\nBackground: \n\nOwen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.\n\nShapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.\n\nThe Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.\n\n----\n\nWe are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.\n\nI think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come.
