Text Content: I see many people on the right falling for this illusion of Biden being a weak incumbent. And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.

This election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in "Zuck bucks" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who "voted" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.

But forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. 

I just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).

So, what is the plan for 2024 ?

Right now, the extreme right and extreme left are making ultimatums out of the most basic function of government. The hard truth: BOTH PARTIES ARE OUT OF CONTROL WITH SPENDING AND NO AMOUNT OF WINDOW DRESSING CAN HIDE THAT FACT. At what point do we the people put an end to the drama?

I see it this way:

A: We declare a broad-based tax and debt strike - just sit on the cash and remind them that if they want the country opened back up again - they have to play ball our way. Go in that room, cuss each other. Fight club. I don't care - but in a few hours you come back out of that room with a budget for each government department that makes sense - or no dice.

B: We move somewhere else. The nation has become hostile to anyone who isn't far-right or far-left. Controversy and outrage are the new currency. Neither party has a platform or agenda anymore outside of being the biggest, most hysterical laughing stock the world has seen - mired in pedophilia and compulsive lying on both sides. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO RAISE CHILDREN HERE IN THE NATION'S CURRENT STATE.

Something has to give. And I think it should be 535 people who we pay to insider trade and fail us and our kids all year long. Let's flip the script.

No one supports Biden… but he got 81,000,000 votes.

Ok.
Text Content: Figured I would open a discussion thread on this.

Tucker Carlson just released a sit down interview with Owens effectively taking a dunk on Shapiro. There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.

Background: 

Owen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.

Shapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.

The Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.

----

We are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.

I think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come. It reminds of of CAGOP.

The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in "Zuck bucks" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who "voted" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.

But forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. 

I just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).

So, what is the plan for 2024 ?

Let's just pass a bill that rolls over previous budgets set by Congress lawfully indefinitely until they pass a new one. That way - we can measure the cost of their inaction in dollars and cents. Right now, the extreme right and extreme left are making ultimatums out of the most basic function of government. The hard truth: BOTH PARTIES ARE OUT OF CONTROL WITH SPENDING AND NO AMOUNT OF WINDOW DRESSING CAN HIDE THAT FACT. At what point do we the people put an end to the drama?

I see it this way:

A: We declare a broad-based tax and debt strike - just sit on the cash and remind them that if they want the country opened back up again - they have to play ball our way. Go in that room, cuss each other. Fight club. I don't care - but in a few hours you come back out of that room with a budget for each government department that makes sense - or no dice.

B: We move somewhere else. The nation has become hostile to anyone who isn't far-right or far-left. Controversy and outrage are the new currency. Neither party has a platform or agenda anymore outside of being the biggest, most hysterical laughing stock the world has seen - mired in pedophilia and compulsive lying on both sides. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO RAISE CHILDREN HERE IN THE NATION'S CURRENT STATE.

Something has to give. And I think it should be 535 people who we pay to insider trade and fail us and our kids all year long. Let's flip the script.

No one supports Biden… but he got 81,000,000 votes.

Ok.
Text Content: Figured I would open a discussion thread on this.

Tucker Carlson just released a sit down interview with Owens effectively taking a dunk on Shapiro. There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.

Background: 

Owen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.

Shapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.

The Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.

----

We are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.

I think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come. It reminds of of CAGOP.

I see it this way:

Go in that room, cuss each other. Fight club. I don't care - but in a few hours you come back out of that room with a budget for each government department that makes sense - or no dice.

B: We move somewhere else. The nation has become hostile to anyone who isn't far-right or far-left. Controversy and outrage are the new currency.

Text Content: Figured I would open a discussion thread on this.

Tucker Carlson just released a sit down interview with Owens effectively taking a dunk on Shapiro. There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.

Background: 

Owen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.

Shapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.

The Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.

----

We are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.

I think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come. It reminds of of CAGOP.

Text Content: I see many people on the right falling for this illusion of Biden being a weak incumbent. And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.

This election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in "Zuck bucks" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who "voted" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.

But forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. 

I just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).

So, what is the plan for 2024 ?

Text Content: Figured I would open a discussion thread on this.

Tucker Carlson just released a sit down interview with Owens effectively taking a dunk on Shapiro. There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.

Background: 

Owen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.

Shapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.

The Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.

----

We are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.

I think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come. It reminds of of CAGOP.

Text Content: I see many people on the right falling for this illusion of Biden being a weak incumbent. And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.

This election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in "Zuck bucks" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who "voted" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.

But forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. 

I just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).

So, what is the plan for 2024 ?

The Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today). She acted as if it had nothing to do with it... I don't know who believes that. But those who are pro-terrorist are more than willing to carry water for her.

We are seeing a fracturing of the right. This is not a good sign right before the 2024 election. You have certain Republicans like Catturd saying they won't vote for Republicans anymore because 8 Republicans in a slim majority voted against impeachment.

I think every indication is that grifters are driving the coalition into the ground and Democrats are going to run unopposed for years to come. It reminds of of CAGOP.

This guy was punished for almost two years for being a patriot, we must do anything we can online in order to set him free.

They see better use of their money in our primaries. Another sign the left is salivating at the thought of Trump being our nominee.

Text Content: I see many people on the right falling for this illusion of Biden being a weak incumbent. And they have been factoring Trump's legal battles and how it effects him in 2024, all that aside. Here is how Biden wins despite every single factor favorable to Trump, DeSantis, Haley, etc.

This election is not going to have the same conditions prior to 2020. Instead the norm is 2020. COVID era election laws are still in place. The only one I have heard being reversed is in GA and FL ( thanks to Kemp and DeSantis ). Trump and a couple other elephants have urged this, but there are two problems: (1) GOP plutocrats don't want to match the roughly billion dollars in "Zuck bucks" to pay the harvesters, and (2) Red vote counters would have to commit the same crimes as their blue counterparts. Ballot harvesting is requesting, completing and/or delivering mail-in ballots; not only for actual voters, but also for the moved, dead and fictional, who "voted" by the tens of thousands in 2020. Harmeet Dhillon is the only lawyer I know who has been concentrating on the challenges ahead come 2024. She was supposed to be chair of the RNC.

But forget what Trump has in mind, wtf has the GOP and the RNC have in mind ? What has Ronna Romney McDaniel done till today - since 2020 ? Is the RNC prepared for lawfare that will be coming in 2024 over voting ? Are their lawyers ready? DNC have their lawyers LINED UP for 2024 ready to file the same lawsuits they had in 2020. They are super confident that they have an infrastructural advantage. Ballot harvesting/chasing/knocking on doors/ strong ground game, yes these are the things that will determine the 2024 election. 

I just read a recent tweet posted by Mark Elias (for those who don't know this guy, he's responsible for Biden's 2020 victory via mass mail in ballot) - that he lost a lawsuit to the 8th circuit - and he's losing so many suits because his 2020 election laws were BS, but were temporarily granted. People need to understand this, once those COVID era laws were put in place, it became harder to undo that because in legal process, it takes time. There are dismissal based on standing and  laches ( this is why late Nov 2020 lawsuits were tossed out ).

So, what is the plan for 2024 ?

Text Content: Great quote about rules for them versus rules for us:
>"The DOJ can call anybody or can convict anybody on anything," Chansley added. "I believe it was Clarence Thomas that said the average American citizen breaks six federal laws each day. So our list of rules for the government is a page or two. It's called the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, but their list of rules for us are thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of pages at this point – hence why the average American citizen breaks six federal laws a day.,"

There were no medical indications of asphyxia or strangulation.”

>For political reasons, the prosecutors buried the truth. To save his career and possibly his life, Baker finessed his findings to include “neck compression” and declared the manner of death a homicide. So doing, he gave the state the wiggle room it needed to slip a noose around Chauvin’s neck.

Text Content:  I've had it up to here with the budget chaos in DC. Enough is enough. Let's just pass a bill that rolls over previous budgets set by Congress lawfully indefinitely until they pass a new one. That way - we can measure the cost of their inaction in dollars and cents. Right now, the extreme right and extreme left are making ultimatums out of the most basic function of government. The hard truth: BOTH PARTIES ARE OUT OF CONTROL WITH SPENDING AND NO AMOUNT OF WINDOW DRESSING CAN HIDE THAT FACT. At what point do we the people put an end to the drama?

I see it this way:

A: We declare a broad-based tax and debt strike - just sit on the cash and remind them that if they want the country opened back up again - they have to play ball our way. Go in that room, cuss each other. Fight club. I don't care - but in a few hours you come back out of that room with a budget for each government department that makes sense - or no dice.

B: We move somewhere else. The nation has become hostile to anyone who isn't far-right or far-left. Controversy and outrage are the new currency. Neither party has a platform or agenda anymore outside of being the biggest, most hysterical laughing stock the world has seen - mired in pedophilia and compulsive lying on both sides. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO RAISE CHILDREN HERE IN THE NATION'S CURRENT STATE.

Something has to give. And I think it should be 535 people who we pay to insider trade and fail us and our kids all year long. Let's flip the script.

Text Content: Figured I would open a discussion thread on this.

Tucker Carlson just released a sit down interview with Owens effectively taking a dunk on Shapiro. There is open X warfare between the two parties now. So this drama is heating up and it could mean an exit of Candace Owens from Dailywire.

Background: 

Owen has been baiting anti-Israel/Pro-Hamas comments for the last month since the massive terrorist attack on Israel. Many people were demanding Jeremy Boreing and Ben Shapiro call her out. They remained silent. Jeremy finally spoke out that he strongly disagreed with her, but said she had a right to her own opinion and he doesn't dictate opinions to his hosts.

Shapiro who clearly has a very different opinion than Candace finally at an event responded to her constant disturbing remarks in a pretty strong fashion.

The Tucker Interview seems suspiciously planned and quickly put together between these two parties. As in Candace was intentionally baiting Shapiro for her grift. Candace put up a Bible Quote on X that is clearly in reference to this conflict and she was called out by Shapiro (who probably knew the interview with Tucker that was set to attack him was launching today).
