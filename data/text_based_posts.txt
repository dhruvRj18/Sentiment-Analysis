Text Content: How do you guys feel about how frequent the use of buzzwords is now? I feel that people just use certain words when they’re upset or disagree with someone nowadays rather than use the word how it’s intended. I’ve heard the words “manipulative, abusive, and narcissistic” come out of people’s mouths after a failed relationship but when delving deeper into it realize none of this was present and it seems the user is being disingenuous to discredit their ex partner who they’re just not fond of anymore and try to victimize themselves for validation from others in a kind of “look what this person put me through they’re terrible I’ve been done so wrong”, this really takes away from real victims who’ve actually endured things. It’s okay to not like someone but throwing out these buzzwords is really damaging for the person being lied on and genuine victims.

Text Content: How do you guys feel about how frequent the use of buzzwords is now? I feel that people just use certain words when they’re upset or disagree with someone nowadays rather than use the word how it’s intended. I’ve heard the words “manipulative, abusive, and narcissistic” come out of people’s mouths after a failed relationship but when delving deeper into it realize none of this was present and it seems the user is being disingenuous to discredit their ex partner who they’re just not fond of anymore and try to victimize themselves for validation from others in a kind of “look what this person put me through they’re terrible I’ve been done so wrong”, this really takes away from real victims who’ve actually endured things. It’s okay to not like someone but throwing out these buzzwords is really damaging for the person being lied on and genuine victims.
